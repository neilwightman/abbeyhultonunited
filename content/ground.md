In 1985 Abbey Hulton United Football Club acquired a piece of land at Birches Head Road on which it was able to obtain a 99 year lease.
This is the clubs current address. Immediately, a clubhouse was built containing a bar and changing rooms for both teams and officials.
At the same time an outside 5 a-side football facility was built, complete with floodlights.

In the season 2016-2017 Abbey Hulton United FC won the Leek Cup and were the Staffordshire County Premier League champions.
We felt that it was the right time to apply to go into the Hallmark Security League. Major ground improvements had to be achieved
to allow us to enter the League. With great support form Club members and local volunteers this has been achieved. After all the
hard work we were proud to be accepted into the League.
